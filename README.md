# MangaRock Crawler

## Components

- Manga Downloader
- Manga Parser and Converter
- **Manga Viewer**

This document only introduces the Manga Viewer which contains most of features among Downloader and Parser. I think this can satisfy common needs with a GUI panel. 

## Requests

- Python 3
- Requests (for Downloader)
- appJar (for GUI base)
- Pillow (for Images in Viewer)

## Installation

1. Download source code from GitHub.
2. Make sure all needed libraries are in the latest versions.
3. Run the command in the source directory:
   `python gui.py` OR `python3 gui.py`
4. A new window is shown. You can download and view manga here.

## How to use

### 1. Copy the URL of a manga chapter

The URL is similar to this `https://mangarock.com/manga/mrs-serie-61792/chapter/mrs-chapter-61794`. You can find it at chapter list of a manga.

### 2. Download manga

Run the gui.py, click on the **Download** button. Paste the copied URL and choose the target directory. I recommend to save manga data in an unchanged directory and name it with clear title like "Domestic_Girlfriend_1".

Click **OK** to start downloading. Downloading will take some times depending on the connection stablity. All images of the specific chapter will be download and stored as PNG file. You can watch PNG image in any software you like.

The first page of the chapter will be loaded in viewer automatically when downloading is finished.

### 3. Read manga

Like most of manga viwer, there are a pair of buttons to jump to previous and next pages. Also, there are an another pair of buttons to modify image displaying such as zoom in and out images, move images in four directions. Moreover, some keys are registered for common usage.

### 4. Load existed manga

Once the whole chapter of manga is downloaded, you can load it directly without re-downloading. Choose the directory of manga, the content will be loaded automatically.

### 5. Change app language

Currently, English and Simpified Chinese are supported. You can change language at setting panel. By default, English panel is displayed. Besides, the translations only work for fixed words in widgets, which means the contents from MangaRock such as introduction are shown in English.

### 6. Auto downloading

By auto downloading enabled, you can download manga chapter without specify the directory name. Also, you can custom the naming format of manga. In the future version, more convenient features will use auto downloading such as auto loading next and previous chapter.

When you activate auto downloading, the root directory of manga chapters and naming format have to be filled. All auto downloaded manga chapter will store in the root directory with proper name. The directory name is generated by the combination of naming labels and connection characters.

Currently, there are four labels for directory naming: `%MangaName%`, `%Order%`, `%ChapterTitle%` and `%DateTime%`.

- %MangaName%: The name of manga, in English. Such as `Domestic Girlfriend`
- %Order%: The current order in chapter list. Such as `1`
- %ChapterTitle%: The full title of current chapter. Such as `Vol.1 Chapter 1: I Want To Grow Up Soon`
- %DateTime%: Data and time now, in format of *yyyymmddHHMMSS*. Such as `20190101123456`

## More To Do

- Fast loading
- Auto naming(developing)
- Custom downloading(download all chapters, automatically fetch URLs, etc.)
- Searching manga by title
