### Change app language

Currently, English and Simpified Chinese are supported. You can change language at setting panel. By default, English panel is displayed. Besides, the translations only work for fixed words in widgets, which means the contents from MangaRock such as contents are shown in English.

### Auto downloading

By auto downloading enabled, you can download manga chapter without specify the directory name. Also, you can custom the naming format of manga and download next chapter in just one click.

When you activate auto downloading, the root directory of manga chapters and naming format have to be filled. All auto downloaded manga chapter will store in the root directory with proper name. The directory name is generated by the combination of naming labels and connection characters.

Currently, there are four labels for directory naming: `%MangaName%`, `%Order%`, `%ChapterTitle%`, `%DateTime%` and `%JPMangaName%`.

- %MangaName%: The name of manga, in English. Such as `Domestic Girlfriend`
- %Order%: The current order in chapter list. Such as `1`
- %ChapterTitle%: The full title of current chapter. Such as `Vol.1 Chapter 1: I Want To Grow Up Soon`
- %DateTime%: Data and time now, in format of *yyyymmddHHMMSS*. Such as `20190101123456`
- %JPMangaName%: The name of manga in Japanese/Chinese, if it has. Such as `ドメスティック彼女`. This feature doesn't guarantee the right original name. Currently, the rule for the renaming is if there is an alias similar to Japanese, it will be used; otherwise, if there is an alias similar to Chinese, it will be used; otherwise, English name will be used.
